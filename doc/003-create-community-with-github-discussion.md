# 3 - Create your community


## 1- Build a Website with GitHub Pages

GitHub is the place where you build your software, and you can also create documentation, with GitHub Pages. 

Many project or communinities are using GitHub Pages to create their Website for example:
- [InnerSource Commons](https://innersourcecommons.org/) (https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/innersourcecommons.org) 
- [Redisearch](redisearch.io) (https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/tree/master/docs)


If you have some community/communitation to build GitHub Pages is there for you. What we have seen at GitHub and within our user community, is that now developer, project leads, and content creators like to use Markdown with the GitHub Flow (PR+Review) to publish site. This means that Wikis are less and less used.

In the previous lab you have seen how to create a new site for documentation, it is a starting point. 

Let's look now at another great GitHub feature to communicate with your community: **GitHub Discussions**
